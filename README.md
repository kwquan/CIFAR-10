# CIFAR-10 Image Classification
In this notebook, we shall build a convolutional neural network using Keras in order to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. \
This dataset consists of 10 classes with 6000 images each. \
Furthermore, it is split into training set[50000] & test set[10000], therefore having a total of 60000 images. 

# Dataset
Images are of the dimension[32 x 32] with 3 channels[RGB]:
